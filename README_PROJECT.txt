The main contribution of this project is python package hockeydata whose purpose is to make possible to download 
hockey data from eliteprospects.com website into custom DB for further analysis. This package is more closely 
described in README.md file. The examples of scripts that can be used for downloading different entities 
(team, player, league) found on the website can be found in bin folder. Additionaly, the project 
also contains jupyter notebook report in R programming language made with the data downloaded with the methods from 
hockeydata package in the folder reports. Another jupyter notebook file in folder tests then makes possible to test 
individual moduls found in the hockeydata package with various inputs. Lastly, the schema of database which the 
methods from package create and put scraped data into can be found in folder database.
