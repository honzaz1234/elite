Major contribution of this project is python package hockeydata whose purpose is to download hockey data from eliteprospects.com website into a DB. 
This package is more closely described in README.md file. Additionaly, there can be also found jupyter notebook report in R programming language 
made with the data downloaded with the methods from hockeydata package in the folder reports. Another jupyter notebook file in 
folder tests then makes possible to test individual moduls found in the hockeydata package with various inputs. Lastly, the schema of database 
which the methods from package create and put data into can be found in folder database.
