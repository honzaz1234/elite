The core contribution of this project is the Python package hockeydata, which enables downloading hockey data from both EliteProspects and NHL.com into a custom database for further analysis.

* The package itself is documented in detail in README.md.

* Example scripts for downloading different entities (teams, players, leagues, games) are provided in the bin/ folder.

* The database schema used to store the scraped data is available in the database/ folder.
